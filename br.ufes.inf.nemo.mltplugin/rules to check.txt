ClassWrapper:
	- (DONE) Verify cardinality for power types in instantiation relations
		- (DONE) MLT power types are targets of a instantion relation where target.multiplicity == ONE_TO_MANY
		- (DONE) MLT power types must be targets of a instantiation relation
	- (DONE) A base type is source of at most one MLT power type through an instantiation relation
	- (DONE) Verify hierarchy order
	- (DONE) Verify instantion cycles
	- (DONE) Set order
	- Complicated checking of power types hirarchies
	- Complicated checking of specialization bet power type and characterizers of a given type

AssociationWrapper:
	- (DONE) (UNTESTED) if(isInstantiation) then target.order == source.order+1
	
GeneralizationWrapper:
	- 

GeneralizationSetWrapper:
	- (DONE) The UML power type of a generalization set cannot be a MLT power type
	- (DONE) Verify matching UML power type and characterizator type
	- (DONE) Verify disjointness and completeness according to instantiation cardnilaty
		- (DONE) If target.upperBound == 1, then isDisjoint == true
		- (DONE) If target.lowerBound ==0, then isComplete == false
	- umlPowerType.order == superType.order++
	- Complicated checking of no specialization between partitioners of a given type
